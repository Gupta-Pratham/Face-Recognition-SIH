# Face Recognition System (SIH Prototype)

## Overview
This project is a working face recognition prototype developed for Smart India Hackathon (SIH).  
It demonstrates face detection, training, and recognition using classical computer vision techniques.

## Problem Statement
Manual identity verification is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This system automates identity recognition using facial features.

## Features
- Face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier
- Dataset creation and training pipeline
- Real-time face recognition
- Modular Python code structure

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning
- Haar Cascade Classifier

## Project Structure
- `train.py` – Trains the face recognition model
- `face_recognition.py` – Handles face detection and recognition
- `student.py` – Manages student data
- `main.py` – Entry point of the application
- `classifier.xml` – Trained face recognition model
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` – Face detection model

## Future Improvements
- Use CNN-based face recognition (Deep Learning)
- Improve accuracy under varying lighting conditions
- Deploy as a web-based application
